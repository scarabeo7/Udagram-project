 jobs: # we now have TWO jobs, so that a workflow can coordinate them!
   one: # This is our first job.
     docker: # it uses the docker executor
       - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1 # specifically, a docker image with ruby 2.4.1
     # Steps are a list of commands to run inside the docker container above.
     steps:
       - checkout # this pulls pulls code down from GitHub
       - run: echo "A first hello" # This prints "A first hello" to stdout.
       - run: sleep 25 # a command telling the job to "sleep" for 25 seconds.
   two: # This is our second job.
     docker: # it runs inside a docker image, the same as above.
       - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1
     steps:
       - checkout
       - run: echo "A more familiar hi" # We run a similar echo command to above.
       - run: sleep 15 # and then sleep for 15 seconds.
 # Under the workflows: map, we can coordinate our two jobs, defined above.
